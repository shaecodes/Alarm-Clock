# Alarm Clock
The Alarm Clock is a simple GUI-based alarm clock program implemented in Python using the tkinter library. It allows users to set an alarm time in 24-hour format and plays a sound when the set time is reached.

# Features
Set alarm time: Users can set the hour, minute, and second for the alarm time using the provided input fields.
24-hour format: The alarm time is set and displayed in 24-hour format.
Sound notification: When the alarm time is reached, the program plays a sound using the winsound module to notify the user.
User-friendly GUI: The program provides an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) for setting the alarm time.

# Requirements
Python 3.2
tkinter library (pre-installed with Python on most systems)
winsound library (pre-installed with Python on most systems)

# How to Use
Run the program by executing the Python script.
Set the alarm time by entering the hour, minute, and second in the respective input fields.
Click the "Set The Alarm" button to set the alarm.
The program will continuously check the current time and play the alarm sound when the set time is reached.
To stop the program, close the GUI window.
Note: The program uses a sound file named "sound.wav" for the alarm sound. Make sure to place the sound file in the same directory as the Python script.
